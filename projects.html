                In this project for my stage design class my group and I have developed a script 
                breakdown for the play "No More Monsters Here" by Marcus Gardley. We have conducted visual 
                and thematic research for this play by creating a pinterest board and exploring unqiue and 
                creative approaches to stage design.

                In this project for my Data Structures course at Boston College I created a user-based
                game called "Bulls and Cows" using <strong>Java</strong>. The presmise of the game is to 
                discover what the randomly generated computer number is with 10 guesses. The only aide 
                recived is a <strong>Bulls indicator (which means right digit and right placeholder)</strong> 
                or <strong>Cows indicator (which means right digit wrong placeholder). </strong>

                In this project for my Web development course I applied many of the skills and lessons
                I learned from class to create my own portfolio website. I used <strong>HTML, CSS, and 
                JavaScript to develop this website.</strong>
