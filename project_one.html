                    In this project for my stage design class my group and I have developed a script 
                    breakdown for the play "No More Monsters Here" by Marcus Gardley. We have conducted visual 
                    and thematic research for this play by creating a pinterest board and exploring unqiue and 
                    creative approaches to stage design. 
                </p>

                    For our final design we have decided to go with a surrealistic approach to the set design.
                    This entails  a more dream like effect on our play. We hope to acheive this with a
                    pixelated videogame-like backdrop and exaggerated actions.
