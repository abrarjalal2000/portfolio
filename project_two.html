                In this project for my Data Structures course at Boston College I created a user-based
                game called "Bulls and Cows" using <strong>Java</strong>. The presmise of the game is to 
                discover what the randomly generated computer number is with 10 guesses. The only aide 
                recived is a <strong>Bulls indicator (which means right digit and right placeholder)</strong> 
                or <strong>Cows indicator (which means right digit wrong placeholder). </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the intitial stages of this game I had kept the size of the random integer fixed to 4 digits,
                however, since then I have added levels to the game and added more digits. Ultimately, the goal
                was to make it harder for the user to win as he or she progressed through the levels.
